                    &ensp; Hello I'm Iestin, and welcome to my site! I'm
                    currently a Senior Full-Stack Software Developer. As you can
                    imagine, I spend a lot of time programming, not only during
                    work but also in my free time. I'm always looking for new
                    projects to work on and new technologies to learn.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &ensp; When I'm not programming, you might find me gaming on
                    my PC, exploring the great outdoors and photographing
                    wildlife, whipping up new recipes in the kitchen, or
                    creating music. That really just scratches the surface, as I
                    tend to pick up all sorts of hobbies and interests.
