                    &ensp; Hello and welcome to my site! I'm Iestin, a driven
                    and creative senior full-stack software developer. While
                    coding is my bread and butter, I also have a diverse range
                    of interests that keep me inspired and energized.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &ensp; When I'm not programming, you might find me gaming on
                    my PC, exploring the great outdoors and photographing
                    wildlife, whipping up new recipes in the kitchen, or
                    creating music. I'm also passionate about graphic design,
                    and while I still have a lot to learn, the skills I've
                    developed have been invaluable in my career.
                </p>

                <p>
                    &ensp; By pursuing such a variety of interests, I've
                    discovered that a lot of them complement and enhance each
                    other in unexpected ways. Whether I'm experimenting with
                    software development or learning an instrument, I approach
                    every challenge with the same curiosity and determination.
